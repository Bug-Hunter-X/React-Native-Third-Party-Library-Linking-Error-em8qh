The solution involves meticulously checking the library's installation and linking instructions.  For iOS, ensure you've run pod install and that your project settings reflect the library correctly. For Android, make sure the necessary configurations are in your `android/app/build.gradle` and `settings.gradle` files.  Also verify the library's import statements and ensure the correct native modules are correctly linked and accessible within your React Native application.  If the library has a manual linking step, this needs to be completed as instructed by the library's documentation. Thoroughly verify that you have followed all steps as outlined in the library's documentation.
