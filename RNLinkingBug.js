This error occurs when using a third-party library in React Native that has native modules. The library might not be correctly linked to your project, resulting in an error when you try to use its features.  It often manifests as a runtime error, rather than a compile-time error, making it harder to debug. This is particularly true when working with libraries that interact with native iOS or Android code, like those that use camera functionalities or handle complex UI elements.
