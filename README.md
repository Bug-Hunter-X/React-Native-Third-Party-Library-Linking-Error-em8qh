This repository demonstrates a common but elusive bug in React Native applications involving third-party libraries that expose native modules. The bug is characterized by the absence of compile-time errors, with issues surfacing only at runtime.  The solution involves verifying the library's installation and linking procedures, ensuring proper configuration in both Android and iOS projects. The example uses a hypothetical library for illustration purposes.
